## Using graphs for notetaking

I recently switched from Roam Research to Obsidian for my personal knowledge management system. I love the graph view in both tools, but I prefer Obsidian's implementation, in which I "own" all of my notes. Obsidian is just a nice UI for managing my Markdown files.

I use Obsidian in a pretty simple, flat way: 

- No folders
- Tags for context that transcends topics (e.g. "#project", "#idea", "#reference")
- Links between notes to connect ideas
- Daily notes for journaling and task management

How I learn with Obsidian:

- I open a daily note, and write down what I'm working on or thinking about.
- I link to existing or new notes based on topics that come up
- To consolidate my learning, I take my daily notes and summarize them in the topic-based notes.
